The `AWSJSON` scalar type provided by AWS AppSync, represents a JSON string that complies with [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259).  Maps like "**{\\"upvotes\\": 10}**", lists like "**[1,2,3]**", and scalar values like "**\\"AWSJSON example string\\"**", "**1**", and "**true**" are accepted as valid JSON and will automatically be parsed and loaded in the resolver mapping templates as Maps, Lists, or Scalar values rather than as the literal input strings.  Invalid JSON strings like "**{a: 1}**", "**{'a': 1}**" and "**Unquoted string**" will throw GraphQL validation errors.
